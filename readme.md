# Shipment Data Analysis for Performance Improvement

## Project Overview

The objective of the Shipment Data Analysis project is to analyze historical shipment data to derive insights and identify trends and patterns in delivery times and order fulfillment rates. By employing statistical techniques, the project aims to understand delivery performance better, optimize delivery processes, reduce lead times, and enhance overall customer satisfaction.

## Use Case

The project focuses on leveraging statistical analysis techniques to gain insights into the performance of shipment processes. Specifically, it aims to achieve the following:

- **Identify Trends:** Analyze historical data to identify trends in delivery times and order fulfillment rates.
- **Pattern Recognition:** Utilize statistical methods to recognize patterns in shipment data, including peak times, delivery delays, and order processing times.
- **Performance Optimization:** Use insights from the analysis to optimize delivery processes, reduce lead times, and improve overall performance metrics.
- **Enhanced Customer Satisfaction:** By optimizing delivery processes and reducing lead times, the project aims to enhance customer satisfaction levels.

## Key Objectives

- Analyze historical shipment data using statistical techniques.
- Identify trends and patterns in delivery times and order fulfillment rates.
- Optimize delivery processes to reduce lead times and enhance customer satisfaction.
